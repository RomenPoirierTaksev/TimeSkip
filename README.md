# TimeSkip
A chrome extension that skips the episode to the title card of One Piece on Crunchyroll

Scrapes the comments of the episode to get the time of the title card, and skips to that time in the video.

You can either clone this repo, or you can download the extension from the Google Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timeskip/giaaeacihhelmkfcdfkepoijleaddajp/related?hl=en-US
